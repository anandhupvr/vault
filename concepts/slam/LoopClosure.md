	to stay close to the mode of the map distribution
Global Loop Closure
	to avoid drift and maintain global consistency

- map to map
- image to map
-  image to image


Dictionary
creating a dictionary of vectors( or map/images) of images

Determining loop closure hypothesis

 - Loop closure probability
 - NN (nearest neighbor) search (cosine distance)

	when the different place look similar  ( past image look like the current image but dot not come from the same scene)
